## Getting Started

To use N1ghtw1re System News in your project, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/n1ghtw1re/n1ghtw1re-system-news.git](https://github.com/n1ghtw1re/n1ghtw1re-system-news.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd n1ghtw1re-system-news
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser** to view the application directly.
4.  **Embed in an iframe:** To integrate the news app into your website, use an `<iframe>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to the `index.html` file. For optimal display, set the `width` to approximately 800 pixels.

    ```html
    <iframe src="path/to/n1ghtw1re-system-news/index.html" width="800" height="[adjust height as needed]" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    ```

## Managing News Content

The news content is stored in a JavaScript file (likely named `news.js` or similar) within the project. To update the news:

1.  **Locate the news data file.**
2.  **Open the file in a text editor.**
3.  **You will find an array (e.g., `const newsItems = [...]`) containing news objects or strings.**
4.  **Edit the array:**
    * Add new news items to the beginning of the array to have them appear as the latest news.
    * Modify existing news text.
    * To create a link, use standard HTML `<a>` tags within the news text. For example: `"Check out the <a href='https://example.com'>latest updates</a>!"`.
    * Ensure each news item is correctly formatted according to the existing structure.
5.  **Save the changes to the news data file.**

The application will automatically display the latest 5 items from this array when loaded.

## Customization

While the application is designed with a specific retro aesthetic, you can customize the styling by modifying the CSS file (`style.css` or similar). You can adjust colors, fonts, the burn-in effect, and other visual aspects to better suit your needs.
